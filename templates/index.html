        <h2 onclick="toggleAnswer(1)" class="question">Question 1: How do cloud platforms enable the storage and processing of large datasets required for real-world AI projects?</h2>
        <p id="answer1" class="answer">Cloud platforms offer scalable storage and computational power, allowing efficient handling of large datasets. They provide distributed storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) and parallel processing capabilities using services like Hadoop or Spark. This ensures quick access, real-time updates, and seamless integration with AI tools for training and inference.</p >
        
        <h2 onclick="toggleAnswer(2)" class="question">Question 2: Why are web applications essential for providing user-friendly interfaces to deploy and interact with AI models?</h2>
        <p id="answer2" class="answer">Web applications bridge the gap between complex AI models and end-users by offering intuitive, interactive interfaces. These interfaces simplify model deployment, allow real-time inputs, and present outputs in a comprehensible way. By using frameworks like Flask or Django, developers can integrate models into accessible dashboards or APIs for broader use.</p >
        
        <h2 onclick="toggleAnswer(3)" class="question">Question 3: How do cloud services support the scalability of AI projects when handling high volumes of real-time data?</h2>
        <p id="answer3" class="answer">Cloud services provide elastic computing resources, automatically scaling infrastructure based on demand. They manage data streams with tools like AWS Kinesis or Google Pub/Sub, ensuring low-latency processing. Additionally, they enable horizontal and vertical scaling of AI models to accommodate high traffic or data influx efficiently.</p >
        
        <h2 onclick="toggleAnswer(4)" class="question">Question 4: How do web applications facilitate the integration of AI models into end-user environments for real-world applications?</h2>
        <p id="answer4" class="answer">Web applications act as intermediaries, connecting backend AI models with user-facing tools. They enable smooth data exchange via REST or GraphQL APIs and ensure models are accessible through browsers or mobile apps. They also offer mechanisms to customize AI outputs to specific user needs, enhancing usability.</p >
        
        <h2 onclick="toggleAnswer(5)" class="question">Question 5: How do cloud-based AI services simplify model training, deployment, and monitoring in real-world scenarios?</h2>
        <p id="answer5" class="answer">Cloud-based AI services (e.g., Azure Machine Learning, AWS SageMaker) provide end-to-end solutions for model lifecycle management. They automate training with pre-configured environments, simplify deployment via containerized solutions, and offer monitoring tools for tracking model performance, ensuring reliability and scalability in production.</p >
